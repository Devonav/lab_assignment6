Program Name: BinarySearchAverage

Description:
The BinarySearchAverage program reads input from a file named "input.txt", where each line specifies the number of input arrays to be processed followed by the size of each array and its elements. The program calculates the average of the elements in each array and then searches for this average value within the array using a binary search algorithm. It outputs whether the average value is found in the array and its corresponding index if it exists.

File Structure:

BinarySearchAverage.c: Contains the C source code for the program.
input.txt: Input file containing the number of arrays, size of each array, and elements of each array.
